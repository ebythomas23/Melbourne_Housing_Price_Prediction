**Melbourne Housing Market Analytics**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting housing market trends in Melbourne, Australia, using historical real estate data. The aim is to analyze regional housing price trends and build predictive models to forecast future prices. This project is part of a data science portfolio to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

-----
**Objectives**

- Analyze historical trends in median housing prices by region and property type.
- Build predictive models to forecast median housing prices.
- Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize trends and predictions.
-----
**Dataset**

The dataset, sourced from [Data Melbourne](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/), includes:

- Median prices for dwellings/townhouses and apartments.
- Transaction counts by sale year and CLUE small areas in the City of Melbourne.

**Key Features**

- sale\_year: Year of property sale.
- small\_area: Geographic region within Melbourne.
- type: Property type (e.g., House/Townhouse, Residential Apartment).
- median\_price: Median price of properties (target variable).
- transaction\_count: Number of transactions in each area and year.
